## Technologies used ##
- GUI: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Web services: Jersey (JAX-RS), Java,
- Semantic Web technologies: RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQl, Jena, Ontologies
- Server: Google Cloud Platform (previously called Google Application Engine)

## Documentation: Semantic Web Best Practices Handbook for Dummies ##
This documentation shares a set of semantic best practices:
http://perfectsemanticweb.appspot.com/documentation/SemanticWebBestPracticesForDummies.pdf

The documentation aims to:
* Help improve your ontologies
* help fix errors encountered to design perfect ontologies with existing Semantic Web (SemWeb) validation or documentation tools such as TripleChecker, OOPS, WebVOWL, Parrot, Vapour, LODE, etc.
* Encouraging semantic interoperability.


## Documentation to set up the project, code reuse, etc. ##
Documentation to set up such projects hosted on Google Application Engine:

M3 project is a full project, PerfectO is one of the components.
All components use the same technologies, follow the same implementations and methodologies.
We aim to make this component as much independent as possible to improve its usability.

Now, there is the dedicated PerfectO web site: http://perfectsemanticweb.appspot.com/
